## 📌 Overview

**WorldEdit** is a large-scale benchmark and unified framework for open-world image editing. It aims to systematically evaluate and advance image editing models beyond narrow-domain or template-based settings.

 **WorldEdit** introduces:

- 🌍 A large-scale open-world image editing benchmark covering diverse real-world scenarios  
- 📊 A standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline  
- 🧠 A strong editing model designed for general-purpose open-domain editing  
 

To ensure fair and scalable evaluation, we provide an automated assessment framework built upon vision-language models, enabling consistent scoring across different editing systems.

This repository includes:

- 🔧 Model inference code for WorldEdit  
- 🗂 Benchmark construction tools  
- 📈 Evaluation scripts and scoring pipeline  

For more details, please refer to the [project page](https://worldedit0.github.io/WorldEdit/) and the [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ErPfOExrrr).


## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WorldEdit0/WorldEdit-2026.git
cd WorldEdit-2026
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Conda Environment

Create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n worldedit python=3.10 -y
conda activate worldedit
```

### 3️⃣ Install Project Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🧠 Model Inference

### Step 1: Download Model Weights

Download the official WorldEdit model from Hugging Face:

```bash
huggingface-cli download WorldEdit0/WorldEdit2026 \
    --repo-type model \
    --local-dir weights/ \
    --resume-download
```
---

### Step 2: Run Inference

```bash
python infer.py
```

---

## 📊 Benchmark Evaluation

WorldEdit provides a standardized benchmark for evaluation.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Download Benchmark Dataset

```bash
cd eval

huggingface-cli download WorldEdit0/WorldEdit \
    WorldEdit/test-00000-of-00001.parquet \
    --repo-type dataset \
    --local-dir eval/worldedit_bench \
    --resume-download
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Build the Benchmark

```bash
cd worldedit_bench
python build_bench.py
cd ..
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3A: Evaluate Official WorldEdit Model

If you want to evaluate results generated by the official WorldEdit model:

```bash
bash infer.sh
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3B: Evaluate Your Own Model

1. Place your edited `.png` results into:

```
eval/output/
```

2. Run evaluation:

```bash
bash eval.sh
```

---

## 🔑 Evaluation API Requirement

The evaluation pipeline uses:

> **Qwen-VL-Max** on Alibaba Bailian Platform

You must obtain an API key from:

👉 https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/?tab=model#/api-key

Set your API key in the eval.sh before running evaluation.
